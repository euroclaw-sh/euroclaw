# @euroclaw/vendors

Vendor-coupled authoring glue, one subpath per vendor — the foundation-tier home for the small
pieces that must import a third-party SDK. Feather-light by design: each subpath depends on
`@euroclaw/contracts` and its vendor SDK only — no runtime, no engine — so a host's shared tools
library (or a euroclaw plugin, under the plugins-import-foundation-only rule) can use it without
dragging the execution stack. There is deliberately no root export.

## `@euroclaw/vendors/ai-sdk`

`tool()` defines a governed AI-SDK tool in one place: the model-facing definition
(description/inputSchema/execute — input inference preserved, the overloads mirror the AI SDK's
own) plus the euroclaw governance stamp (`gate`/`effect`/`invoker` and the authz-model facts
`access`/`groups`/`resource`/`audit` — what the OpenAPI/MCP generators derive from specs, an
author declares here). `govern()` (re-exported from contracts) remains the adoption path for
tools you didn't author; both produce the identical stamped shape the runtime reads back through
its validated reader.

Schemas: `inputSchema` takes the AI SDK's own schemas (zod / `jsonSchema()` / lazy) **or any
standard-schema library directly**, following the Elysia multi-schema pattern (a minimal
structural `~standard` marker; the input type computed from the captured schema generic). The
bridge is **capability-based, not vendor-based**: a standard schema that can emit JSON Schema
(arktype's native `toJsonSchema()`) is bridged automatically — provider-facing JSON Schema from
the library, validation incl. morphs through `~standard.validate`, inference preserved; one that
can't fails loud, because bare standard-schema defines validation only and a tool schema must
produce the JSON Schema sent to the provider. `standardSchema()` is exported for direct use with
plain `aiTool`. euroclaw tools are always executable (the chokepoint requires `execute`), so
`tool()` has one signature and returns a plain `AuthoredTool` shape (structurally assignable to
the AI SDK's `Tool`, asserted by a type test — no casts); exotic AI-SDK fields (streaming hooks,
provider-defined tools) go through `govern(aiTool(...))`.
