// The facts overlay — a customer's per-action override of the DERIVED model facts, and the mapper
// that turns stored registered-tool rows into action inputs. Overlay-wins per field (access,
// resource, audit REPLACE; groups REPLACES when present — replacement is the predictable rule, never
// a union). A write→read change is a LOOSENING: still applied (the report is the guardrail, per the
// plan), but returned loudly so boot/registration can surface it — never silent. A duplicate
// override for one action id is a config bug and THROWS (same posture as buildAuthzModel's
// duplicate-id throw). An override whose action id matched nothing is reported (a typo must not
// vanish). Both this and the row mapper feed buildAuthzModel — the model is the convergence point.
