// The shadow policy engine — slice 6b. `shadow` mode is a REAL second evaluation, not a flag: this
// wraps a live engine + a candidate, evaluates BOTH per decision, and when their decisions diverge
// calls an injected `observe` callback — then returns the LIVE result UNCHANGED. Shadow never changes
// the answer; it only records what the candidate WOULD have decided. Engine-agnostic; `observe` is a
// host callback (routed to audit/telemetry), NOT a new port. Installed only when the bundle has a
// candidate set (loadPolicyBundle → bundle.shadow).
//
// STRICT ISOLATION — a "safe to experiment with" shadow slice must NEVER break live authorization,
// so EVERY candidate failure mode is contained and the live result is always returned:
//   - construction: the candidate is a LAZY builder, built once here in a try/catch; a malformed
//     shadow policy set (a customer typo) that throws at build → shadow is disabled, live is served.
//   - evaluation: the candidate's authorize runs best-effort; a rejection is swallowed.
//   - observe: a throwing host observer is swallowed — it fires exactly on divergence and must not
//     take down the very decisions it is meant to only watch.
