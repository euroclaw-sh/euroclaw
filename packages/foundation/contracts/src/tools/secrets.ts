// schema; the resolver is host-wired code, not something that crosses a boundary as data.
//
// euroclaw stores NO secrets. The host wires this seam to wherever credentials actually live —
// env vars, AWS SSM, Infisical, Vault, a DB-backed credential entity later — each an ADAPTER
// behind the one port, added without touching the invoker or each other. The resolver returns
// secret MATERIAL only; HOW to apply it (apiKey-in-header-named-X, bearer, basic) is read from
// the registered spec's own `securitySchemes` (the specBlob is kept claim-check style for
// exactly this). Token-minting flows (OAuth client-credentials, refresh) live INSIDE a resolver
// implementation — it returns a fresh token like any other material.
// See docs/plans/authz-blueprint-plan.md (slice 6a, secrets ruling).
