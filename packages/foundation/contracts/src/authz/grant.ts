// The generic shareable-resource ACL — the `access_grant` entity + the `AccessGrantStore` port
// (docs/plans/app-authz.md §6, build-slice 5). ONE table for EVERY shareable resource (claw, thread,
// skill, …): `resourceKind` is an OPAQUE label the core never interprets (exactly like `scope`), so a
// new shareable kind needs ZERO new authz code — just a loader (assembly) that presents its base row.
// SUPERSEDES the skills plugin's bespoke `skill_acl` (its split `principalType`+`principalId` collapses
// into the unified `principalRef`; its `share` permission folds into `manage`).
//
// The PEP feeds `listForResource` grants straight into the generic decision — the {@link AccessGrant}
// projection IS what `decideApiCall` renders (no translation seam). Rows are IMMUTABLE: a share is an
// INSERT, an unshare a DELETE (grants are DATA, never compiled policy — the authz bundle never moves).
//
// Impl lives in @euroclaw/storage-durable (createAccessGrantStore); this module holds only the entity
// declaration, the arktype record/create schemas, the derived types, and the behavioural store port.
