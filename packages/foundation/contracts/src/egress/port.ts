// The egress enforcement PORT — the ONE abstraction every sandbox egress backend implements,
// GENERIC across all three tiers (blocked / allowlist / interceptor). It sits between euroclaw's
// Cedar policy (the *what's allowed*) and each backend's native egress mechanism (the *how it's
// enforced*). Modeled on the PolicyEngine port (authz/engine.ts): a behaviour port plus a declared
// `capability` the system reads to warn when an org's policy needs enforcement a tier structurally
// cannot apply — no silent over-claim. Ports are behaviour, not data — plain TS, no schema/arktype
// (like PolicyEngine and SecretResolver, these are host-assembled, not values crossing a boundary).
//
// DOM-free on purpose: @euroclaw/contracts builds without the DOM lib and plugins import it, so the
// connection-level request / response / socket shapes are STRUCTURAL mirrors (the SandboxFetch
// convention), never DOM Request/Response/ReadableStream.
//
// See docs/plans/sandbox-egress-slice2-enforcement-port.md (this port + the compiler) and
// docs/plans/sandbox-egress-plan.md (the backend landscape + honest tiering).
