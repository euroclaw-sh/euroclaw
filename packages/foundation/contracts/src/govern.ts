// The per-tool governance CONTRACT (a port). Generic and runtime-free: `govern` just stamps
// a gate onto a tool-like object — it never runs a tool or imports a framework. Each adapter
// (the AI SDK claw, a future LangChain adapter, …) provides the IMPLEMENTATION: it reads the
// stamped `euroclaw` field and wires the gate into the pipeline. Contract here, impl there.
//
// The stamp's data shape is an arktype schema, not a plain type, because adapters read it
// back through type-ERASING framework types (the AI-SDK ToolSet drops `euroclaw` entirely),
// so the compiler cannot check what a host attached. A typo'd effect policy would fail OPEN
// (e.g. idempotency "nonee" ≠ "none" → the effect gets auto-retried); schema validation at
// the read boundary fails loud instead.
