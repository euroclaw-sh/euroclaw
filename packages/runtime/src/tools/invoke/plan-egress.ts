// The egress plan COMPILER: given a backend's declared egress capability (+ the Cedar policy, the
// stamped facts, and the secret resolver the interceptor outbound will consume), produce the
// enforcement that backend can actually apply — and NEVER silently over-claim what a tier
// structurally cannot do.
//
// The counterpart of the PolicyEngine port on the egress side: `planEgress` reads a backend's
// `EgressCapability` and emits an `EgressPlan` matched to it, plus `UnenforcedNote`s for every policy
// dimension the chosen tier cannot enforce (surfaced both at boot and per-execution — decision 4).
//
// Slice-2 scope: `blocked` and `allowlist` are compiled concretely here; the `interceptor` plan's
// governed outbound is DEPENDENCY-INJECTED via `buildOutbound` (tests pass a fake; slice 3 supplies
// the real authorize → floor → claim-check → audit outbound). This keeps the compiler pure — types +
// branching — with the interceptor implementation cleanly deferred. Co-located with tools/invoke/
// because that slice-3 outbound reuses the invoke credential + floor + audit stages.
